[Instructions with Screenshots](http://wipeoutmedia.com/whats-new/css-javascript-toolbox/)

After you have uploaded and activated the CSS & JavaScript Toolbox plugin, you will notice a new menu item appear under Settings in your Dashboard. Click 'CSS & JavaScript Toolbox' link in the left admin bar of your dashboard.

Write the code, then choose what the code affects
Clicking into the toolbox link from the WordPress Dashboard for the first time, you will see a CSS & JavaScript Block.  Inside this block is a large editor window, and this is where you write your CSS or JavaScript code.  To allow your code to run on your website, you need to specify the pages, posts, categories, or page URLs you want the code to work with.  You can select multiple checkboxes and even make selections from the other tabs – just make sure you click the Save All Changes button when you are done. The three tab sections are shown in the slideshow below.  Note: clicking the small box icon with the arrow in the corner will open the page for testing purposes.

Adding default CSS or JavaScript declaration code
If you want to add CSS or JavaScript declaration code snippets, but can never remember how they go, that’s cool, we have included these as default code snippets in the drop-down list box.  Simply choose the one you want, and click the button with the green down arrow.

Creating and saving your own code snippets This plugin allows you to create and save your own snippets of code so you can reuse it across additional CSS & JavaScript Blocks.  To create and save your own snippets of code, simply click the button with the green cross.  You will see a popup window, where you can create a title for your code, and enter the actual code in the main text area.  Once you are happy with your code snippet and title, click the Save Code Template button.

You can then click the drop-down list, select the code title you provided, and then click the green down arrow button to insert the code into the editor window.

Adding more CSS & JavaScript Blocks We understand that one CSS & JavaScript Block is not enough.  You may want to affect a different page with a whole new set of code.  In this scenario, we have you covered.  Look below the bottom of the block and you will find a button labelled Add New CSS/JS Block.  Click that to add an entirely new CSS & JavaScript Block.

Although this plugin uses Ajax for the function calls (in other words does not refresh the webpage), please remember to save your code on a regular basis by clicking the Save All Changes button.
